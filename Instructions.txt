Notes about the solution

Added the following indexes to the database (init.sql):
1. B-tree indexes on sales_manager_id, booked and date_range to improve the queries on slots table since the solution query involves querying by these columns
2. GIN indexes on languages, products and ratings arrays on sales_managers table to improve querying managers who has specific languages, products or ratings (used GIN since it's the suitable index for array values)
3. View available_slots that contains the non-overlapping slots for the sales managers
